# Golang Example Repository Using TestContainer

This repository is structured to demonstrate the use of TestContainer in Go (Golang) projects.


The repository contains several components essential for a Go project:

- **README.md**: Documentation for the repository.
- **cmd/api**: Contains the main application and handlers for the API.
- **coverage.html & coverage.out**: Files related to test coverage.
- **go.mod & go.sum**: Go module files for managing dependencies.
- **internal/services**: Service layer of the application, including tests and mocks.
- **internal/testutils**: Utilities for testing, particularly with MongoDB.
- **internal/usecases**: Usecase implementations for the application.

This structure is typical for Go projects and facilitates the organization and testing of various components, especially with the inclusion of TestContainer for containerized testing environments.
